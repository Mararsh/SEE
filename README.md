Software Engineering Environment(SEE) is a general frame to customize and manage information. The default information set is the data for software development. Users can manage tables like Problem Reports, Change Requests, Working Log and Plans, Testing Cases, etc.
It is written in servlet and data are saved in XML, and run in web container like Tomcat.
Any data structures can be added and customized.

The project was developed in 2014 and sited on https://sourceforge.net/projects/chong2see/.

I wrote it to implement the idea that all data, including interface styles, can be customized, managed, and exchanged in pages online. Many things have changed and programmers have made their workings much smarter with their brilliant tools. Thanks for all shares on internet! Hope I could share more.
