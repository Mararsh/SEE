Software Engineering Environment(SEE) is a general frame to customize and manage information. The default information set is the data for software development. Users can manage tables like Problem Reports, Change Requests, Working Log and Plans, Testing Cases, etc.
It is written in servlet and data are saved in XML, and run in web container like Tomcat.
Any data structures can be added and customized.

The project was developed in 2004 and sited on https://sourceforge.net/projects/chong2see/.

I wrote it to implement the idea that all data, including interface styles, can be customized, managed, and exchanged in pages on-line. Many things have changed and programmers have made their workings much smarter with their brilliant tools. Thanks for all shares on Internet! Hope I could share more.

I copied the last version on GitHub now: https://github.com/Mararsh/SEE .

And its documents: https://mararsh.github.io/SEE/docs. 
For Chinese readers, you have to set your browser's encoding as "Simplified Chinese" if the document pages are messed since they were written with GB2312. 

Following are some snapshots of the interface.
